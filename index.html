							<h2>Author</h2>
							<p>Guy Rosmarin is a writer with a very distinctive style. His first novel, Yesterday's Tomorrow, was released this past fall and is already generating much interest for its unique fusion of historical fiction with realism, mystery, suspense and fantasy.</p> <p>Guy is a lover of music - from Bach to Pearl Jam and much in between, a world traveler who backpacked south-America, launched a spiritual journey in the Himalayas, learned to scuba in Honduras, found the perfect beach in Thailand, and surfed the perfect wave in Costa Rica. In constant search of his inner voice, Guy often struggles to find the right words, but on good days they end up finding him.</p>

<p>When Guy is not writing, he works as a post audio engineer, recording and mixing short films and commercials for television, radio, and the web.</p>

<p>Guy lives down the Jersey shore with his wife, two kids, their cat, and their dog.

If you're down there on a pre-dawn hour beach stroll, you may run into Guy surfing.</p>

							<h2>Sound Engineer</h2>
							<p>Armed with a dual bachelor-degree in music and philosophy from the City College of New York, Guy Rosmarin launched his career in the Audio world as an intern at the busy Manhattan Center Studios located in the midst of the Hammerstein Ballroom in midtown NYC. Soon after, Guy was hired as an assistant audio engineer and quickly rose through the ranks as he gained invaluable experience in the recording studio, working alongside the Industry’s bests for top label producers and artists such as Timbaland, Bon-Jovi, Supertramp, Harry Connick Jr., and many more.</p>

								<p>Guy continued to enrich his experience with analog mastering, reformatting, preservation and restoration, serving as the senior audio engineer at the archiving facility Vidipax.  From there, Guy made the leap to post-production when he joined Vision-Post (Townhouse Studios today) at Grey Advertising, where he has spent the past ten years recording, mixing and sound designing commercials for TV, Radio, and the Web.</p>
							 
							 <p>With a career spanning over nearly two decades between recording studios and post-houses, Guy acquired extensive knowledge working with the latest and oldest technologies and nearly every possible audio format - from a variety of analog and digital mixing and mastering consoles, outboard processors and all-in-the-box digital workstations, to analog tape-machines, 78’ discs, magnetic wires and wax-cylinders (the list goes on…)</p>
							 
							 <p>Guy’s experience along with his diligence, high work ethics, and friendly team player approach helped advance his technical and creative skillset in the studio, field, and every other work-environment he is in.
